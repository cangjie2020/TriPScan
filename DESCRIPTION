Description: Translation elongation is a crucial step in the translation process,
  and tRNA is an indispensable component during this process. 
  If there are abnormalities in tRNA expression, it may lead to changes in the 
  ribosome translation speed during the elongation process. Based on tRNA-seq and 
  Ribo-seq data, we have identified differential ribosome stalling sites caused by 
  tRNA expression differences during translation elongation. Furthermore, 
  we can calculate the changes in translation efficiency of the genes at these 
  differential ribosome stalling sites
